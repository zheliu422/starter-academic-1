Hello, Welcome to my page! 

My name is Zhe Liu! I graduated from Georgia Tech in 2022 with a MSECE degree with a passion in VLSI design. I am a DRAM Design Verification Engineer at Micron Technology at Atlanta working on pre-silicon [DDR5](https://www.micron.com/products/dram/ddr5-sdram?campaignid=15060332554&adgroupid=137460394748&keyword=ddr5%20micronkw=ddr5%20micron&matchtype=e&network=g&device=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwz96WBhC8ARIsAATR251SuLU6QB6pbSIUzaHUtIVkfmWjIr_ElukHhz6kpbLG6_AxCBYRyesaAtJ1EALw_wcB) design and verification. We are responsible for delivering cutting-edge, industry leading DRAM solution that can support complex and high-performance compute SoC functions in the most efficient manner.

I very much look forward to the challenge and exciting career in engineering! Please feel free to reach out to me
