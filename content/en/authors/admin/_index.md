Hello!! Welcome to my website, my name is Zhe Liu! I am currently a DRAM Design Verification Engineer at Micron Atlanta. 

I graduated from Georgia Tech with a MSECE degree. I have 5+ years in the field of Electrical Engineering with focus on digital design/verification. I also have 2+ years of experience in IC design.

Currently I am working full time as a design verification engineer. In this year I'll be assisting the full chip verification for one of Micron's state-of-art [DDR5](https://www.micron.com/products/dram/ddr5-sdram?campaignid=15060332554&adgroupid=137460394748&keyword=ddr5%20micronkw=ddr5%20micron&matchtype=e&network=g&device=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwz96WBhC8ARIsAATR251SuLU6QB6pbSIUzaHUtIVkfmWjIr_ElukHhz6kpbLG6_AxCBYRyesaAtJ1EALw_wcB) project. Go Micron! Together, we shape the future!

Started from June 2021, I worked at [Georgia Tech Analog Mixed-signal Microsystems and Applications (GAMMA)](https://gamma.ece.gatech.edu/) group as a graduate researcher under the supervision of Dr. Shaolan Li. In this role, I was focused on a post-silicon performance measurements project of a novel noise-shaping SAR ADC. Works included measurement of performance parameters (e.g. SNDR, SFDR, DR, etc.), validation of PVT robustness, and demonstration of ADC performance by ECG signal input. This work has been successfully accepted by ISSCC 2022 conference and the measurement part played a key role to the successful publication. I have also worked on numerous successful class design projects. More details about my experience can be found below. 

I very much look forward to the challenge and exciting career in engineering! Please feel free to reach out to me. Also, please download my latest Résumé {{< staticref "uploads/ZheLiuResumeV11.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.
