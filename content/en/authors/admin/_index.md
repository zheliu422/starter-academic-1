Hello!! My name is Zhe Liu! I am currently a Master's student at Georgia Tech. I have been studying in the field of Electrical Engineering for five consecutive years. I am ready to devote myself wholeheartedly to apply what I learned from school to industry!

Started from June 2021, I worked at [Georgia Tech Analog Mixed-signal Microsystems and Applications (GAMMA)](https://gamma.ece.gatech.edu/) group as a graduate researcher under the supervision of Dr. Shaolan Li. In this role, I was focused on a post-silicon performance measurements project of a novel noise-shaping SAR ADC. Works included measurement of performance parameters (e.g. SNDR, SFDR, DR, etc.), validation of PVT robustness, and demonstration of ADC performance by ECG signal input. This work has been successfully accepted by ISSCC 2022 conference and the measurement part played a key role to the successful publication. I have also worked on numerous successful class design projects. You can see more details about my experience below. 

I will be a hard-working and determined person which will be a great foundation to start a career in your industry as an engineer. I very much look forward to the challenge and exciting career in engineering! Please feel free to reach out to me.
