## Overview
The design exhibits a 4 GHz 1-bit SRAM cell on 45nm CMOS technology. A based dynamic power supply is integrated into the design with a motivation to switch between two voltage levels (Vcc_hi and Vcc_lo) during READ and WRITE operations. This design has been implemented in Cadence Virtuoso for both schematic as well as the layout. The simulation result has proven the improvement in both Read and Write margins. Furthermore, simulation showed the SRAM cell leakage power consumption is reduced.
