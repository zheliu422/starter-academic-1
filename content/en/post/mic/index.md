## Overview

In this project, we designed a 2-stage pipelined Successive Approximation Register (SAR) Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). SAR ADC architectures are popular for achieving high energy efficiency but they suffer from resolution and speed limitations. The pipelined SAR architecture divides a moderate resolution SAR ADC into some low resolution SAR ADCs.
The target specifications are given in the following table:
