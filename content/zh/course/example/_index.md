## Project Overview

People are not completely confident in the expiration dates that are on food packaging. This is because they are not accurate! They are more like a guideline and the product can often still be consumed long after the date on your milk carton. In North America, 42% of the total food available is lost or wasted and 61% of that is coming from the end consumer. If we can penetrate this industry starting with dairy, we can showcase a new age of packaging technology that can revolutionize and limit food wastage.
